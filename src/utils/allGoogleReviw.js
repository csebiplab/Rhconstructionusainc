I have not worked with too many contractors but it seems that many of them neglect to communicate details that I would like to know. Minar, on the other hand, despite the fact that English is not his first language, worked hard to keep communication open during the life of the project. Repeatedly, he checked in to make sure I was happy with not only the work but the way in which it was being done. He and his crew worked quickly and with great care for my pregnant wife, our neighbors, and everyone‚Äôs schedules. Be careful though, make sure to go over details ahead of time because they work so fast that sometimes they will complete part of the project before you expect them to. Almost always a pleasant surprise. As our main project progressed numerous other little jobs came up. Minar was not only capable of handling a variety of different types of work, but he worked with us in an open manner to come to a fair and agreeable price. I was so pleased working with him that I recommended him to our condo board where he has continue to deliver very satisfactory work for our building. And now I recommend him to you.",
